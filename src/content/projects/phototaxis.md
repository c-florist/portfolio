# Overview

Phototaxis, as the name suggests, studies how the movement of a "motile organism" (moths in this case) is affected by a light source. This is a pretty simple sketch at the moment, I wanted to focus on the atmosphere and the interaction of the moths first and foremost.

It's best viewed on desktop where you can orbit the scene with the left and right arrow keys, but swiping on mobile should work too.
