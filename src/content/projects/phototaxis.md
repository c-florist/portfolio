# Overview

Phototaxis, as the name suggests, studies how the movement of a "motile organism" (moths in this case) is affected by a light source. This is a pretty simple sketch at the moment, I wanted to focus on the atmosphere and the interaction of the moths first and foremost.

Interaction is kept to a minimum with this one, but you can orbit the scene with the left and right arrow keys.
